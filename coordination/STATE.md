# Coordination state

Where the project actually is, in one screen. Read this first; it is the
entry point to the rest of `coordination/`.

Last updated: 2026-09-17

**This file does not own research truth.**
[`CFL_RESEARCH_STATE.md`](../CFL_RESEARCH_STATE.md) is authoritative for every
experiment, freeze, hash and verdict, and `tests/test_research_state.py` checks
it against the bytes on disk. This file summarises and links. Where the two
disagree, the research register wins and this file is the one that is wrong.

## The loop

```
Claude builds  →  writes HANDOFF.md  →  ChatGPT reviews  →  writes the next spec
      ↑                                                              │
      └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                        Reed appears only at an L3 gate
```

| file | what it is for |
|---|---|
| [`STATE.md`](STATE.md) | this file — current position, refreshed at every handoff |
| [`TASK_QUEUE.md`](TASK_QUEUE.md) | what is queued, who owns it, what level it is |
| [`DECISIONS.md`](DECISIONS.md) | append-only log of decisions and who made them |
| [`HANDOFF.md`](HANDOFF.md) | the live baton — newest entry at the top |
| [`CRITICAL_GATES.md`](CRITICAL_GATES.md) | the L0–L3 ladder and the closed L3 list |

Git history is the audit trail. These files are the working surface.

## Where the project is

### Research

| line | state | see |
|---|---|---|
| DUR-001 — does PROP-0001@v1 beat the totals market? | collecting | [register](../CFL_RESEARCH_STATE.md) |
| DUR-002 — the same question for the uncalibrated hazard | **armed**, zero observations | [register](../CFL_RESEARCH_STATE.md) |
| PROP-0001 | frozen, serving locks | [register](../CFL_RESEARCH_STATE.md) |

**The duration model is read-only.** Development on it is finished; both
experiments run untouched until their evaluation points.

### CLV — the active line

[`research/clv/CLV_MEASUREMENT_PROTOCOL.md`](../research/clv/CLV_MEASUREMENT_PROTOCOL.md)
is **draft**, with ChatGPT for methodological review before freeze. It is a
measurement protocol, not a model experiment — no hypothesis, no challenger, no
verdict — so it lives outside the DUR register.

Two gates, deliberately separate:

| | state |
|---|---|
| capturing raw market quotes | **running** — does not wait for anything |
| computing a CLV summary statistic | **blocked** until freeze |
| putting a CLV number on a surface | **blocked** until freeze |

Nothing renders CLV today; `track-record.html` carries a placeholder. Row-level
settlement into `model_edges` continues — bookkeeping, not a published result.

### Where the work moves next

Stated in the research register, in priority order:

1. **Market / closing-price capture and CLV** — the biggest statistical
   dependency for showing CFL has an economically meaningful edge. *Active.*
2. Customer monetisation.
3. The win-probability engine.

### Open owner decisions

**DUR-001 amendments.** Nine held clauses — (a) (b) (c) (d) (e) (f) (g) (j) (k)
— remain PROPOSED and each needs an individual vote on its actual clause text.
They are explicitly *not* approved en bloc. Split by risk in the register: six
change data eligibility, scoring, model behaviour or interpretation and get
higher scrutiny; three are governance and monitoring only.

**CLV protocol, five L3 questions** (T-007, blocked behind ChatGPT's review):
Q-05 vigged or de-vigged · Q-06 published probability or wager price · Q-07
aggregation and weighting · Q-08 minimum sample before display · Q-11 how
positive CLV may be described. Each changes what a published number means.

### Site

Plain static HTML/CSS/JS on GitHub Pages; `main` deploys on push. No bundler.
One Node build step (prerender + factor rates) runs on a 6-hour cron. Nothing
on the card is gated in the frontend during beta.

A timed email prompt (T-009, [D-004](DECISIONS.md)) asks signed-out visitors
for an email after two minutes on site. It is a corner card with no backdrop
and no scroll lock, dismissible for good, and it gates nothing — the
no-paywall rule is unchanged. Per-channel detail in
[`TRAFFIC_FUNNEL.md`](../TRAFFIC_FUNNEL.md).

## Refreshing this file

Whoever writes a handoff updates this file in the same commit, and moves the
date. A `STATE.md` that lags the handoff is worse than no `STATE.md`, because
the next reader trusts it.

Keep it to one screen. Detail belongs in the register, the queue, or the
handoff — not here.
